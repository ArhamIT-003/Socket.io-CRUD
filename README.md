# CRUD Operations with ReactJS, Node.js, and Socket.io

## Overview

This project demonstrates a full-stack application that implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using ReactJS for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Socket.io for real-time communication.

## Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Utilize Socket.io to provide real-time updates to the client whenever data changes.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with ReactJS, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.
- **RESTful API**: The backend is structured to handle CRUD operations efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io
